<h4>Running Unit Tests</h4>

<p>
    Unit tests can be run using 
    <br /><br />

    <code>npm test</code>
    <br /><br />
</p>

<h5>What does npm test do?</h5>
<p>
    This will run karma (the test runner) using the configuration found in karma.conf.js. 
</p>

<h5>What does karma.conf.js do?</h5>
<p>
    The base of this file is generated using the karma-cli which can be found on npm. 
    The one included here tells karma to run tests inside of the phantomjs browser, preprocess test-setup.ts using webpack, 
    report results of tests using the spec reporter, and to watch for file changes. 
</p>

<h5>What is phantomjs?</h5>
<p>
    Phantomjs is a headless web browser commonly used for running tests against javascript code. A headless browser means
    there is no visible window. Think of it as a web browser that you don't actually see. It just starts a process
    then runs your site like it was viewed through chrome, or some other browser. Why would we use Phantom? The short answer is 
    speed. Phantomjs will run our tests faster than other browsers. For the most part PhantomJs mimics real browsers well enough
    that we can use it. It is also nice for running javascript unit tests on CI servers because there is no need to launch and interact
    with a real browser window. 
</p>

<h5>What does preprocess test-setup mean?</h5>
<p>
    Preprocessing our typescript is neccessary for a few reasons. The first reason is that browsers don't understand typescript. You could 
    load typescript into a browser, but the browser won't know what to do with it because its not always valid javascript. The other reason
    we need to preprocess our typescript is because we are taking advantage of node for loading packages, other javascript libraries, and 
    our own components. Browsers don't understand what import '@angular/core' means. Webpack (our preprocessor)
    knows how to turn that typescript in to javascript that will work in the browser. That is the job of the preprocessor. It takes our 
    typescript and translates it into something the browser can understand and run. This is neccessary because at the end of the day
    if our application doesn't run in a browser we kind of failed. Our preprocessor is configured using webpack.test.js. 
</p>

<h5>What does webpack.test.js do?</h5>
<p>
    In short wepback.test.js creates the webpack configuration we use for preproccessing our application for testing purposes. When testing we
    don't need to provide an entry point or minify or uglify our application code. This helps speed up preprocessing. The entry point for the
    application becomes the files marked with webpack as the preprocessor. In our case the entry point is our src/test-setup.ts file.
